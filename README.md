# react-no-cra

## Boilerplate for a React app made without create-react-app
create-react-app (CRA) is a nice tool, but forces you to use a lot of often unneeded dependencies and makes is very difficult to change app's settings.
This is a simple boilerplate project, which leverages webpack, babel, CSS loaders and so on, ready to be used and/or modified.
